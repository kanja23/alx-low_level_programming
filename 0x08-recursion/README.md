0x08. C - Recursion   
                                                                                                                                        
In C Programming, if a function calls itself from inside, the same function is called recursion. The function which calls itself is call
ed a recursive function, and the function call is termed a recursive call.                                                              
                                                                                                                                        
Recursion are mainly of two types depending on whether a function calls itself from within itself or more than one function call one ano
ther mutually. The first one is called direct recursion and another one is called indirect recursion.                                   
                                                                                                                                        
The definition of recursion: (a) self-embedding of a syntactic category, thus allowing for an infinite number of sentences.             
                                                                                                                                        
A recursive formula is a formula that defines any term of a sequence in terms of its preceding term(s). For example: The recursive formu
la of an arithmetic sequence is, an = an-1 + d. The recursive formula of a geometric sequence is, an = an-1r.                           
                                                                                                                                        
Why to use recursion. Recursion adds clarity and (sometimes) reduces the time needed to write and debug code (but doesn't necessarily re
duce space requirements or speed of execution). Reduces time complexity. Performs better in solving problems based on tree structures.
